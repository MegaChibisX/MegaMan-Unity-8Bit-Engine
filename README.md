# Unity MegaMan 8 Bit Engine


## Info
As the Blue Bomber doesn't get much love in Unity projects, I thought I would make a simple MegaMan project in Unity 2D and release it for everyone to use.

Download the 'MegaManEngineForUnity' folder and open it with Unity to open the project.

Check out the Manual.pdf file to get a better idea of what this project is like and how it works.
